var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "lzb",
	Short: "Your secrets as a service",
	Long: `Lazenby is a service that keeps your secrets. Most projects have a bunch of shared private data
like database passwords, AWS/GCP tokens etc. Lazenby securely stores these in a file (called the 'lazenfile' by default) that is safe to commit
to your repo, including public repos. Only contributors you add can decrypt it. Lazenby can also emit the variables in ENV_VAR format suitable for
exporting to a shell.

On first use, lazenby will generate 3 files.
'$HOME/.lzb/privatekey': This is your private key (like an ssh key). Keep it safe!
'$HOME/.lzb/publickey': This is your public key. This is what you provide to have yourself added as a user of the lazenfile
'./lazenfile': This is the secrets store.

The lazenfile is a base64 encoded protocol buffer file containing the following:
1. A map of {publickey: encrypted_lazenkey}
2. A map of secrets in the form {name: (encrypted_value, [tags])}

When the lazenfile is first created it contains just a single entry consisting of the creator's public key and a randomly
generated lazenkey encrypted with the creator's public key. Only the matching private key can be used to decrypt the lazenkey.

Each secret is encrypted with the lazenkey using symmetric encryption.

Someone whose public key is already in the lazenfile can add new users, using 'lzb addkey'. This command will read their lazenkeys,
decrypt the lazenkey using their private key, encrypt the lazenkey with the supplied public key and update the lazenfile with the new
publickey: encrypted_lazenkey pair.
